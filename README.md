# TripcodeGenerator

Tripcode Generator was written in Javascript and HTML, and generates insecure tripcodes for Futaba-based imageboards. A copy of the project can be found live at [https://orph.link/tripgen

### Performance

The performance of Tripcode Generator should vary greatly and is dependent on multiple factors:
* Browser's settings (many of which might throttle Jquery intervals)
* Processor speed
* **Your luck** (tripcodes are generated in a random fashion)
* Tripcode matching settings (Case insensitive and contains should be fastest)

### WARNING
Choosing the "ends with" matching pattern might result in a situation where there are no matching tripcodes. **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**
